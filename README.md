### Assignmet Project for Getting and Cleaning Data course

This project is used for create tidy data from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

### Files
- *CodeBook.md*: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that i performed to clean up the data   

- *run_analysis.R*: this script does the following

    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject       

- *tidy_data.txt*: A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
